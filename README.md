Overview:
Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) pose significant risks to patient safety and healthcare costs. This project implements a deep learning-based model to predict ADRs using drug attributes and patient data, enhancing drug safety and development.

Features:
Uses deep learning (dense & convolutional layers) for prediction.
Processes both categorical and numerical features.
Evaluates performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC.
Aims to improve healthcare outcomes with AI-driven insights.

Technologies Used:
Python,
TensorFlow/Keras,
Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-learn,
Matplotlib/Seaborn

Dataset:
Includes drug profiles and patient characteristics.
Preprocessed to handle categorical and numerical data.

Model Architecture:
Multi-layer deep learning model with dense & convolutional layers.
Trained to recognize patterns in drug-patient interactions.

Results:
Achieved high accuracy in ADR prediction.
Performance measured using AUC-ROC, precision, and recall.

Future Improvements:
Enhance dataset size for better generalization.
Implement explainable AI techniques for better interpretability.
